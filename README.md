# AI Football - Football Players Detection and Analysis

## Project Overview

**AI Football** is a computer vision-based project that aims to analyze football players' movements and positions using deep learning models. The project provides real-time detection, heatmap visualization, and analytical insights about player performance on the field.

### Key Features:
- **Player Detection:** Uses advanced object detection models (YOLOv8) to identify players on the football pitch.
- **Heatmap Generation:** Visualizes player movements by creating heatmaps that show their activity over time.
- **Field Layout Detection:** Automatically recognizes the football field layout to align with player positions.
- **Voronoi Diagram Creation:** Divides the field into regions of control based on players' positions, offering insights into team dominance.

### Models Used:
- YOLOv8 for real-time object detection
- Custom models for heatmap and Voronoi diagram generation


This project was inspired by a tutorial on YouTube by Roboflow. I have made several modifications and enhancements to the original approach to better suit the specific requirements of this project.
